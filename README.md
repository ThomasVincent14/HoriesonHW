## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- The motivation for this project was to clean up the website to make it more presentable and accessible for visually impaired individuals. I didn't build this particular but I did do mostly all refactoring to get the results I needed. This project taught me that companies can be held liable if their website is not accessible for handicapped individuals. 

## Installation
The first thing I did to get the website where it should be was that I first changed the title in line 7 from 'webiste" to "Menu | Horieson". I then changed a few "div" properties to "nav" to help VS code figure out where to go in the code. Next, I added "alt text" to all the images on the page by putting "alt=text" next to the image link. To get the "SEO" tab to take the user to the search engine optimization paragraph, I incorporated a "div id" property in line 30.

## Usage
In order to optimize the total usage of the changes I made, you would simply have to click on the "SEO" tab and have to direct you to the paragraph about search engine optimization. To get a clearer understanding of the images, you would have to hover over the images themselves. To understand where you are on the company website, you would have to look up at the title tab on the webpage.
